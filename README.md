# Hi ! 👋

I'm Charli, a former engineering student, now a grown up doing code for work 💻

I'm 24 and use `they/them` pronouns 🏳️‍🌈

Most of my projects here were made for school, but there are some personal realisations.

I mosly do front/fullstack web development, but I've experimented with Robotics and AI in my line of work and my studies.

Currently I'm doing the AdventOfCode, but I don't know how long it'll last so... we'll see!

Have fun in your life and bye!
